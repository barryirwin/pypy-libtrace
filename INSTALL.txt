pypy-libtrace INSTALL instructions
------------------------------------

Requirements:

 * libtrace 3.0.21 or later
 * ldns, which requires an up-to-date version of openssl
 * pypy version 4.0.1 (including CFFI 1.3.0) or later
 * python setuptools (e.g. using get-pip.py, see
   https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/#installing-with-get-pip-py )
 

Installing pypy-libtrace
------------------------

Check that you have the right version of libtrace, pypy, openssl
and ldns (as listed above).  For openssl on Ubuntu, you may need
to create a sumbolic link in /user/include, something like this:
  openssl -> /home/nevil/openssl-1.0.1j/include/openssl

You should have obtained pypy-libtrace from github
  git clone https://github.com/nevil-brownlee/pypy-libtrace.git

Now
  cd pypy-libtrace
  make install

The above two of commands will build pypy-libtrace and
install it into the place where pypy expects to find extension
modules on your system.
You'll probably need to use sudo for the make install step.

The library comes with a set of test cases. You can run them to
make sure the installation is complete. They are also useful, if
you want to make changes to the library. In this case, they can
be used to make sure your changes did not break anything in the
library.

To run the tests, go to the 'test' subdirectory and run the sript
'run_test' as follows:

export TZ=Pacific/Auckland  # Get times right for trace file packets
<plt-folder>/test$ pypy run_test.py -d pypy-test-cases/ -t

This command runs all 30 test programs and reports the results.
All tests should pass to make sure the library works properly.

Using pypy-libtrace
---------------------

The best source of information on how to use libtrace and the 
tools that come with it is the libtrace wiki located at 
http://www.wand.net.nz/trac/libtrace/wiki

pypy-libtrace is documented in a set of html pages in the
doc subdirctory of the distribution.
A set of example programs is included in the doc/examples
subdirectory.

You should install these documentation files on a suitable
webserver at your site (or you can see them at
http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~nevil/pypy-libtrace/ )
